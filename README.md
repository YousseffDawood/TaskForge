# TaskForge

A role-based project management web application built with Django. TaskForge allows teams to manage projects, assign tasks, track progress, and communicate through comments — all with a clean, modern interface.

---

## Features

- **Role-based access control** — Three distinct roles: Admin, Employee, and Customer, each with specific permissions
- **Project management** — Customers create projects, admins manage them, employees execute them
- **Task system** — Admins create and assign tasks to employees within projects
- **Comments** — Admins and employees can communicate directly on tasks
- **Notifications** — Users get notified when project or task status changes
- **Status tracking** — Projects and tasks move through Todo → In Progress → Done
- **Admin panel** — Admins can oversee all projects, users, and team members

---

## Roles

| Role | Permissions |
|---|---|
| **Customer** | Create projects, view own projects, receive notifications |
| **Employee** | View assigned projects, update task status, comment on tasks |
| **Admin** | Full access — manage projects, assign tasks, add members, update statuses |

---

## Tech Stack

- **Backend** — Django 4.x
- **Database** — PostgreSQL
- **Auth** — Django AbstractUser with custom roles
- **Frontend** — Django Templates, vanilla CSS, vanilla JS
